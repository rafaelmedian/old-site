{"name":"Rafael Medina","tagline":"UI/UX & Front-End Developer","body":"### My name is Rafael Medina\r\nI’m a town guy maker living in Santo Domingo with a passion for art and technology.\r\n\r\nI’m pretty critical of software. I think software should be enjoyable to use and affect the world in a positive manner. That’s unfortunately not quite the world we live in. But I still deeply love software — I think it’s one of the most powerful inventions of humankind. And I can’t help think that we could do so much more if we held ourselves to higher standards.\r\n\r\nI’m a bit of a hippie, a bit of a capitalist, and a hyperbolic crazy person in between. But you know, maybe that’s just the side effects of working in software and loving art.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant to know more about me or have a cup of coffee?
